App-BCVI-InstallManager

This module is a plugin for 'bcvi' (see: http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-BCVI).
To use it, simply copy the InstallManager.pm file to your $HOME/.config/bcvi/
folder.

The role of this plugin is to track which remote hosts you have installed
'bcvi' to.  Each time you run this command ...

    bcvi --install HOSTNAME

the InstallManager plugin records the hostname and the MD5 checksum of the
'bcvi' script and all its plugins.  Later when you run ...

    bcvi --update-all

the InstallManager plugin will run --install against each host where 'bcvi'
has been installed, but is now in need of an update.
